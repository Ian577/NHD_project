                    Führerbau, which translates to Führer's building in German is a building 
                    that was used as a representative building for Adolf hitler during the 
                    Nazi period. It is located in Munich, Germany, and it was the bulding

                    After the war the Führerbau was used as a storage house for art 
                    that had been stolen by Nazi soldiers. Today it is the main building of the 
                    Hochschule für Musik und Theater München, which is the Munich Usiversity 
                    of Music and Preforming arts.
