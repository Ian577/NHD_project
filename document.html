    <p style="font-size: 23px;">The agreement stated that Germany will invade the sudetenland 
        of Czechoslovakia. It says the invasion will start October 1st, and be completed 
        October 10th. It says the Czechoslovakian government must release any Sudetan German 
        who wishes to be released (including Sudetan Germans in prison for political offences). 
        On the list of signatures you will see Neville Chamberlain, he was the Prime Minister 
        of the United Kingdom. The Munich Agreement was his idea, to settle the dispute 
        between countries. It was a last minute attempt to prevent war.
