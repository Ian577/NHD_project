<h1>When?</h1>

<p style="font-size: 23px;">
    The Munich Agreement took place almost exactly a year before the beginning of 
    WWII (September 1939), in September of 1938. The conference took place on the 29th
    shortly before 1pm, and the debate lasted 3 hours. The Agreement (document) was 
    signed that day.
</p>

<br>

<h1>Where?</h1>
<p style="font-size: 23px;">
    The Munich Agreeement happened in Munich, Germany. The conference, and signing took place in 
    the Führerbau (loosely translating to Führer's building), which was used as a representative 
    building for Adolf Hitler during the Nazi period of WWII.
</p>

<br>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p style="font-size: 23px;">
    The Munich agreement happened when United Kingdom's prime minister Neville Chamberlain
    rquested an imediate meeting to settle the dispute over Czechoslovakia. It was his attempt
    to prevent war with Germany.
